        Hi. My name is Diamond Dang and I'm currently obsessed over this manga called 
        "The guy she was interested in wasn't a guy at all" by artist Sumiko Arai! The
        story revolves around Aya Ooosawa, a popular high school girl who has a secret
        love for rock music. She had never shared her music interest to her popular 
        friends because none of them liked the same music and she's scared she would 
        be alienated. She loves going to record stores to shop for music on her own.
        Although she's not interested in boys, she developed a major crush on the guy
        that works at the record store who dresses super cool and shares many similar
        musical interests with her, with he always wears a face mask to cover his face.
        As it turns out, the cool guy that she has a crush on is the shy girl in the
        same class as her - Mitsuki Koga! Mitsuki knows Aya, but is too scared to reveal
        her true identity and keeps pretending to be this "cool guy" for Aya. Of course,
        Aya will eventually find out...

            It's a simple but fun trope to read about, and what I like most about the this
            manga is the story telling and the relationship dynamic between the two! They
            also have an official playlist of their shared favorite songs that I love to
            listen to when I'm reading this manga. They portray the cutesy but also a bit
            rebelious phase of teenager love very well!
